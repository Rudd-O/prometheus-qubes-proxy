harvest and package qubes-rpc policy and driver from dom0
add error handling:
* what happens if the read() from prometheus takes too long?  cancellation?
* should we close the connection with the browser and kill the qrexec connection?  investigate what happens when the VM or qrexec daemon dies.
* how long do we wait for prometheus to confirm it is in session with us (handshake protocol)?  cancel?
